Sonar - Style Distance Sensing System

This project is a simple sonar system built using Arduino, an ultrasonic sensor, a servo motor, and a Python visualization using Pygame. The servo sweeps the ultrasonic sensor from 0 to 180 to 0 degrees, measures distances, and sends the data to a computer where it is displayed in a sonar-style user interface.


The repository is organized into two main folders:

⦁	firmware
⦁	hardware

Firmware

The firmware folder contains:

⦁	Servo control code
⦁	Ultrasonic sensor test code
⦁	Complete Arduino sonar code
⦁	Python Pygame visualization code
⦁	A document that briefly explains how the code works

Hardware

The hardware folder contains:

⦁	A wiring diagram for the circuit
⦁	A Bill of Materials (BOM) listing all required components
⦁	A document that briefly explains the wiring connections

Getting Started
⦁	Assemble the hardware by following the wiring diagram and the instructions.
⦁	Upload the complete Arduino sonar code to the Arduino board.
⦁	Connect the Arduino to your computer using a USB cable.
⦁	Install Python and Pygame if not already installed.
⦁	Set the correct COM port in the Python code.
⦁	Run the Python script.
⦁	Observe the sonar-style display on the screen.
