# Sonar---Style-Distance-Sensing-System
This project is a simple sonar system built using Arduino, an ultrasonic sensor, a servo motor, and a Python visualization using Pygame. The servo sweeps the ultrasonic sensor from 0 to 180 to 0 degrees, measures distances, and sends the data to a computer where it is displayed in a sonar-style user interface.
